Some of the code fragments are adopted from the books am reading about the
subject and this wonder wheel called the internet. Its all FOSS, though so
feel free to tinker.

Most of the code is adapted from "Linux Device Drivers" by Alessandro
Rubini and Jonathan Corbet, published by O'Reilly & Associates. No warranty
is attached.
